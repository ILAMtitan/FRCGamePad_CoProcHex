# FRCGamePad_CoProcHex
These updated hex files enable a second LaunchPad to be added to one being used as an FRC GamePad from the 2015 KoP.  The only change from the stock is the state of pins 2 and 3 to be high impedance.

Backup existing hex files in the GamePad firmware folder (typically c:\Program Files (x86)\FRC GamePad Tool\Firmware\)
Download and copy provided Hex files to same directory
Use Tool as before
